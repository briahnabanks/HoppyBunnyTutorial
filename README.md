# Hoppy Bunny Tutorial
A tutorial from Make School using SpriteKit.


## Story            
Before starting my Catch Up! game, I used this tutorial to teach myself the basics of SpriteKit with Swift.
## Features
The premise of the game is a bunny that the user keeps afloat by tapping on the screen. The background is scrolling with carrot obstacles of different heights. The users goal is to avoid the obstacles, collecting points for each one.

## Lessons Learned
This tutorial taught me ALOT about SpriteKit that I was able to transfer to my own code. It taught me how to makr a scrolling backdrop, collisions, layering, animations, haptics, and more. It also reminded me how important it is to pay close attention to your code so that you don't make any typos that will result in error.
